scrubby-example
===============

Demo of a generic om widget wrapper to make om widgets "scrubbable"


This won't quite work out of the box, as it's waiting on a pull request to https://github.com/bhauman/devcards

Once that's up to date, you can play with this by doing the following:

    git clone git@github.com:jwhitlark/scrubby-example.git
    cd scrubby-example
    lein figwheel
    # navigate to http://localhost:3449/devcards/index.html#!/scope_devcards.core
