   "# Devcards for scope

    I can be found in `devcards_src/scope_devcards/core.cljs`.

    If you add cards to this file, they will appear here on this page.

    You can add devcards to any file as long as you require
    `devcards.core` like so:

    ```
    (:require [devcards.core :as dc :include-macros true])
    ```

    As you add cards to other namspaces, those namspaces will
    be listed on the Devcards **home** page.
